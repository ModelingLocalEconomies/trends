`preliminary_analysis.ipynb` contains preliminary analysis of the economic and concert data which we conducted prior to employing any machine learning models. The main file with which we used to make predictions is `prediction.ipynb`. 

You can run either on Google Colab or if you have anaconda or Jupyter notebook installed you can run it using that. `prediction.ipynb` contains all the code for data preprocessing, model training and prediction.

The repository contains two extra files `trends.py` and `merge_csvs.py` which were used to scrape Google Trends data and merge all the Google Trends data into single csv files for each state, respectively.
